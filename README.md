```

```bash

```

```bash

```

```

p
```

### parameters:

- This function takes 3 parameters:

  1): The link for the website you want to collect data from (required). For example:

```javascript
 https://example.com
```

2): The type of element you want to collect data from (required). For example:

```bash
 "h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "img", "a", "p", "li"
```

3): The file name you wish to store your data into (optional). For example:

```bash
"headings", "paragraphs", "my heading", "links", "image-links"
```

## NOTE:

- All 3 parameters must be strings.
- After instaling the package, make a folder called "data" in your root directly to store the newly collected data
- If you do not make the folder "data" to store the collected data, it will automatically be generated in the root folder
- If the name of the file to store collected data is not provided, a generic name will be assigned automatically to the newly created file. ie. "842855342.json"
- Do not append the ".json" extention to the file name for storing data as the extention assignment is automated.

### Example:

```javascript
Loader("https://example.com", "h3", "headers") // for h3 (<h3></h3>) element;
```
```javascript
Loader("https://example.com", "p", "paragraphs"); // for 'p' (<p></p>) element
```
```javascript
Loader("https://example.com", "a", "page_links"); // for 'a' (<a />) element
```

### Word of advise:

- With great power comes great responsibility, makes sure to use this package responsibly to avoid your IP address getting blocked.

- Now go collect your data !!!
